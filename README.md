# Auto Insurance Claims Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Integration

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and notebooks for analyzing a simulated dataset of auto insurance claims. The project integrates advanced machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, data exploration, visualization, and AWS cloud services for scalable analytics and deployment.

## Dataset Description
- **auto_insurance_claims.csv**: CSV file containing the simulated dataset of auto insurance claims.
  - Features include claim details, vehicle information, driver demographics, claim amounts, incident types, fraudulent claims, and incident descriptions.

## Files Included
- **auto_insurance_claims.csv**: Dataset file.
- **auto_insurance_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, visualization, NLP, and machine learning integration.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Project Components
1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**:
   - Summary statistics, distributions of numerical variables, and incident types.
   
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling of incident descriptions.
   
3. **Machine Learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow**:
   - Predictive modeling for claim amounts or fraudulent claims.
   - Model training, evaluation, and deployment using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

4. **AWS Integration**:
   - Utilization of AWS S3 for data storage, SageMaker for scalable model training, and Lambda for real-time NLP inference.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd auto_insurance_claims_analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, and required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, scikit-learn, torch, tensorflow, boto3) are installed.

3. **Set up AWS credentials**:
   Configure AWS credentials in your environment for accessing S3, SageMaker, and Lambda services.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open and run `auto_insurance_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to interactively explore the dataset, perform NLP tasks, develop machine learning models, and analyze insights.

5. **Explore and modify**:
   Modify the notebook to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, NLP techniques, AWS configurations, or extend the analysis based on specific project requirements.
