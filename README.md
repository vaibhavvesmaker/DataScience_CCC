# Auto Insurance Claims Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a dummy dataset and corresponding Python scripts for analyzing auto insurance claims. The dataset is generated to simulate various aspects of insurance claims, including policy details, vehicle information, driver demographics, claim amounts, incident types, and fraudulent claims.

## Dataset Description
- **claim_id**: Unique identifier for each claim.
- **policy_id**: Identifier for the insurance policy associated with the claim.
- **vehicle_make**: Make of the insured vehicle.
- **vehicle_model**: Model of the insured vehicle.
- **vehicle_age**: Age of the insured vehicle in years.
- **driver_age**: Age of the driver at the time of the incident.
- **annual_mileage**: Estimated annual mileage for the insured vehicle.
- **incident_type**: Type of incident leading to the claim (e.g., Collision, Theft, Vandalism).
- **claim_amount**: Amount claimed for insurance.
- **fraudulent_claim**: Boolean indicating whether the claim is flagged as fraudulent.

## Files Included
- **auto_insurance_claims.csv**: CSV file containing the dummy dataset of auto insurance claims.
- **auto_insurance_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with Python scripts for data exploration and analysis.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the dataset and analysis.

## Analysis
The analysis involves exploring the dataset to understand the distributions and relationships between different variables:
- Summary statistics
- Distributions of numerical variables (vehicle age, driver age, annual mileage, claim amounts)
- Distribution of incident types
- Distribution of fraudulent claims

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd auto_insurance_claims_analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure Python 3.x and necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) are installed.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open and run `auto_insurance_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to interactively explore the dataset and execute the analysis scripts.

4. **Explore and modify**:
   Modify the notebook to further analyze the dataset, develop predictive models, or explore additional insights based on specific requirements.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a foundational analysis of a simulated auto insurance claims dataset. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to develop predictive models, fraud detection algorithms, and optimize insurance claim processing workflows.
